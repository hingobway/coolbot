# coolbot
A Discord Bot that's a bit useless.
Written in node.js using the discord.js-commando api.

> **Warnings**
> - This bot has not been fully generalized, and therefore will probably not work on your server without quite a bit of switching out IDs.
> - This bot is very much in beta, and is constantly in flux, so expect some bugs.
